## ADAPT: Adaptive Driver Behaviour Modelling for Autonomous Driving Systems

**Status**: *Manuscript in Preparation*

### Abstract

This work presents ADAPT (Adaptive Driver Behaviour Modelling), a novel autonomous driving agent architecture that leverages the NavSim framework for comprehensive driver behavior analysis. Our approach introduces a transformer-based architecture that effectively fuses multi-modal inputs including kinematic data and camera feeds through sophisticated hierarchical attention mechanisms.
