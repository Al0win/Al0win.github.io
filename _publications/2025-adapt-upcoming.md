## ADAPT: Adaptive Driver Behaviour Modelling for Autonomous Driving Systems

**Status**: *Manuscript in Preparation*

### Abstract

This work presents ADAPT (Adaptive Driver Behaviour Modelling), a novel autonomous driving agent architecture that leverages the NavSim framework for comprehensive driver behavior analysis. Our approach introduces a transformer-based architecture that effectively fuses multi-modal inputs including kinematic data and camera feeds through sophisticated hierarchical attention mechanisms.

### Key Contributions

**Novel Architecture Design**
- Developed a transformer-based multi-modal fusion architecture for autonomous driving
- Implemented hierarchical attention mechanisms for processing kinematic and visual data
- Created an explainable framework for anomaly detection in driving behavior

**Dataset Creation**
- Curated a novel dataset specifically designed for benchmarking anomaly detection models
- Utilized the CARLA simulator environment for comprehensive scenario generation
- Established evaluation metrics for autonomous driving behavior assessment

**Explainable AI Integration**
- Designed interpretable anomaly detection mechanisms
- Developed quantitative measures for driving behavior assessment
- Created visualization tools for understanding model decisions

### Research Impact

This research addresses critical challenges in autonomous driving safety by providing:
- Enhanced understanding of driving behavior patterns
- Improved anomaly detection capabilities for autonomous systems
- Explainable AI methods for safety-critical applications
- Comprehensive evaluation frameworks for autonomous driving models

### Supervision

This research is conducted under the supervision of:
- **Prof. Snehanshu Saha**, APPCAIR, Goa, India
- **Prof. Santonu Sarkar**, APPCAIR, Goa, India

### Research Period
October 2024 - Present
