## LLMExam: AI-Driven Question Paper Generation

**Spring 2025**

This project involved developing a sophisticated multimodal system for automated question paper generation from PDF documents.

### Key Features:
- **Multimodal Extraction**: Used Qwen2.5-VL (Vision-Language Model) running locally to automatically extract textual questions, diagrams, and graphs from PDF documents
- **Vector Search**: Implemented vector search capabilities for topic-based retrieval of questions
- **LLM-driven Classification**: Designed an advanced topic tagging mechanism using large language models for precise question classification
- **Automated Pipeline**: Created an end-to-end pipeline for processing educational content

### Technical Stack:
- **VLM**: Qwen2.5-VL for multimodal understanding
- **Vector Database**: For efficient similarity search and retrieval
- **LLMs**: For intelligent topic classification and tagging
- **PDF Processing**: Advanced document parsing and content extraction

### Impact:
This system can significantly reduce the time and effort required for educators to create comprehensive question papers while ensuring proper categorization and coverage of topics.
