## MonetAI: Generating Artistic Images using GANs

**Fall 2024**

This project explored the fascinating intersection of artificial intelligence and art by developing a generative model capable of replicating Claude Monet's distinctive artistic style.

### Project Overview:
MonetAI uses Cycle-Consistent Generative Adversarial Networks (CycleGANs) to learn and replicate the artistic style of Claude Monet, one of the most influential impressionist painters. The model can transform regular photographs into Monet-style artworks while preserving the original content structure.

### Key Features:
- **CycleGAN Architecture**: Implemented cycle-consistent adversarial networks for unpaired image-to-image translation
- **Style Transfer**: Successfully captured Monet's impressionistic style including color palettes, brush stroke patterns, and lighting techniques
- **Content Preservation**: Maintained structural integrity of input images while applying artistic transformation
- **Bidirectional Translation**: Capable of both photo-to-Monet and Monet-to-photo transformations

### Technical Implementation:
- **Framework**: Deep learning implementation using modern GAN architectures
- **Training Data**: Curated dataset of Monet paintings and corresponding landscape photographs
- **Loss Functions**: Combination of adversarial loss and cycle consistency loss for stable training
- **Optimization**: Advanced training techniques to ensure convergence and quality output

### Artistic Impact:
This project demonstrates how AI can learn and reproduce artistic styles, opening new possibilities for:
- Digital art creation and enhancement
- Art education and style analysis
- Creative applications in digital media
- Understanding of artistic technique through computational methods

### Results:
The model successfully generates convincing Monet-style artwork from input photographs, capturing the essence of impressionistic painting while maintaining the recognizable content of the original images.
