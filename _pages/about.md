Welcome to my academic website! I'm Alankrit Singh, a Computer Science undergraduate at BITS Pilani, Goa, with a passion for artificial intelligence, machine learning, and autonomous systems.

## About Me

I'm currently pursuing my Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science at Birla Institute of Technology and Science (BITS Pilani), Goa Campus (October 2022 - May 2026). My research interests lie at the intersection of AI and real-world applications, with a particular focus on autonomous driving systems and understanding the internal workings of AI models.

## Current Research

**ADAPT: Adaptive Driver Behaviour Modelling** (October 2024 - Present)
- Supervised by Prof. Snehanshu Saha and Prof. Santonu Sarkar at APPCAIR
- Developing an autonomous driving agent architecture using the NavSim framework
- Designing transformer-based architectures that fuse multi-modal inputs for anomaly detection in driving behavior
- Creating novel datasets for benchmarking anomaly detection models in CARLA simulator

**nDNA: A Geometric Framework for Tracing the Latent Genome of AI** (July 2025 - Present)
- Supervised by Dr. Amitava Das at Pragya.ai
- Analyzing latent geometry of AI models through Neural Genomics paradigm
- Applying Neural DNA (nDNA) framework integrating Riemannian geometry and statistical thermodynamics

## Experience

I've gained practical industry experience as a **Data Engineer Intern** at Digital India Bhashini Division (May 2024 - July 2024), where I contributed to intelligent data pipeline projects for scalable GenAI-ready NLP data processing and migrated infrastructure from Google Cloud to Azure.

## Academic Involvement

Currently serving as a **Teaching Assistant** for CS F425 Deep Learning at BITS Pilani, where I design tutorials and homework assignments for undergraduate and graduate students. I also volunteered at IndoML 2024, co-organizing the AI symposium in Goa.

## Technical Skills

- **Programming**: Python, LaTeX
- **ML/AI Frameworks**: PyTorch, TensorFlow, Hugging Face Transformers, Scikit-Learn, LangChain
- **Specialized Areas**: Computer Vision, NLP, Multimodal AI, Vector Databases, Retrieval Augmented Generation
